# memorygame
A fairly small and simple memory game I made using vanilla JS with no frameworks or libraries. 

I could probably refactor the code a lot to make it a bit cleaner and shorter but anyway, it's done.

The game creates a new set of matching squares when reset is clicked, so you'll get a new game.
